## Success Metrics

### MVP Success Criteria

We've achieved MVP when:

1. âœ… **Interoperability**: SpecKit and BMAD users can validate plans without
   changing formats
2. âœ… **Validation**: Gate enforces quality standards (lint, test, coverage,
   secrets, policies)
3. âœ… **Safety**: Apply and rollback work reliably with full audit trails
4. âœ… **Integration**: GitHub Action blocks PRs that fail validation
5. âœ… **Adoption**: 15-20 teams using Anvil in production

### Quality Gates for Each Phase

Each phase must meet:

- [ ] > 90% test coverage for new code
- [ ] All integration tests passing
- [ ] Documentation complete and reviewed
- [ ] Security review completed

## Notes

### MVP Philosophy

**Ship Fast, Ship Value:**

- Focus on interoperability (adapters) before fancy features
- Validation and safety before AI assistance
- Working software before perfect software

**Defer Strategically:**

- Advanced features (packs, memory, MCP) come after validation works
- Enterprise features come after product-market fit
- Act 2/3 expansion comes after Act 1 success

### Key Architectural Decisions

1. **APS is internal** - Users never see it unless they want to
2. **Adapters are the wedge** - Work with existing formats
3. **Gate is the trust boundary** - All validation happens here
4. **Evidence is immutable** - Full audit trail always
5. **Safety first** - Rollback capability is non-negotiable
