# Feature: User Authentication System

**Branch**: `feature/001-auth-system` **Date**: 2025-01-15 **Status**: Draft

## User Scenarios & Testing

### P1: User Registration

**As a** new user **I want to** create an account with email and password **So
that** I can access the application securely

**Acceptance Scenarios:**

- User submits valid email and strong password
- System validates email format and password strength
- System creates user account and sends confirmation email
- User receives success message

**Edge Cases:**

- Email already registered → Show error message
- Weak password → Show password requirements
- Invalid email format → Show format error
- Network failure during registration → Show retry option

### P1: User Login

**As a** registered user **I want to** log in with my credentials **So that** I
can access my personalized content

**Acceptance Scenarios:**

- User enters valid email and password
- System validates credentials
- System generates JWT token
- User is redirected to dashboard

**Edge Cases:**

- Invalid credentials → Show error, increment failure count
- Account locked (5 failed attempts) → Show account locked message
- Expired session → Redirect to login with message
- [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should we support "remember me" functionality?]

### P2: Password Reset

**As a** user who forgot their password **I want to** reset my password via
email **So that** I can regain access to my account

**Acceptance Scenarios:**

- User requests password reset
- System sends reset link to registered email
- User clicks link and sets new password
- User can log in with new password

**Edge Cases:**

- Email not found → Show generic message for security
- Reset link expired (24 hours) → Show error, offer to resend
- Weak new password → Show requirements
- [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should old passwords be prevented from reuse?]

### P3: Token Refresh

**As a** logged-in user **I want** my session to be extended automatically **So
that** I don't lose my work due to session expiration

**Acceptance Scenarios:**

- User's token expires during active session
- System automatically requests refresh token
- New JWT token is issued
- User continues working without interruption

**Edge Cases:**

- Refresh token expired → Force re-login
- Network failure during refresh → Queue and retry
- [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What is the token expiration policy?]

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

**FR-001**: System MUST validate email addresses using RFC 5322 standard
**FR-002**: System MUST enforce password requirements: minimum 8 characters, one
uppercase, one lowercase, one number, one special character **FR-003**: System
MUST hash passwords using bcrypt with minimum cost factor of 10 **FR-004**:
System MUST generate JWT tokens with configurable expiration time **FR-005**:
System MUST lock accounts after 5 consecutive failed login attempts **FR-006**:
System MUST send password reset emails with time-limited tokens (24 hours)
**FR-007**: System MUST retain user authentication audit logs for 90 days
**FR-008**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Token expiration time - 15 minutes or 1 hour?]
**FR-009**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should we support OAuth providers (Google,
GitHub)?] **FR-010**: System MUST rate-limit authentication endpoints to prevent
brute force attacks

### Key Entities

**User**

- Represents: A person with access to the application
- Key Attributes: id, email, hashed_password, created_at, last_login,
  account_locked, failed_login_count
- Relationships: Has many AuthTokens, has many AuditLogs

**AuthToken**

- Represents: A JWT token for authentication
- Key Attributes: id, user_id, token, expires_at, refresh_token, created_at
- Relationships: Belongs to User

**AuditLog**

- Represents: Record of authentication events
- Key Attributes: id, user_id, event_type, ip_address, user_agent, success,
  timestamp
- Relationships: Belongs to User

**PasswordReset**

- Represents: Password reset request
- Key Attributes: id, user_id, token, expires_at, used, created_at
- Relationships: Belongs to User

## Success Criteria

### Quantitative Metrics

- Authentication endpoint response time < 200ms (p95)
- Successfully handle 100 concurrent login requests
- Zero plain-text password storage
- Account lockout triggers within 100ms of 5th failed attempt
- Password reset emails delivered within 30 seconds

### Qualitative Metrics

- Users can complete registration in under 2 minutes
- Login flow requires no more than 2 steps
- Error messages are clear and actionable
- Password reset process is intuitive and requires no support intervention

### Security Metrics

- All passwords stored with bcrypt cost factor >= 10
- JWT tokens properly signed and validated
- Rate limiting prevents more than 10 login attempts per minute per IP
- Audit logs capture all authentication events
