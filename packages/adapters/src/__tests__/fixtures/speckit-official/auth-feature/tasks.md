- [084] Set up audit log cleanup job (90-day retention)
- [085] Final code review and cleanup

**Checkpoint**: All tests passing, security measures verified, documentation
complete

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Required Sequential Order

- Setup (001-005) must complete before Foundational (006-015)
- Foundational (006-015) must complete before any user story implementation
- Registration (016-027) should complete before Login (028-043)
- Login (028-043) should complete before Password Reset and Token Refresh

### Parallel Work Opportunities

- Password Reset (044-064) can be developed in parallel with Token Refresh
  (065-074) after Login is complete
- Within each user story, test writing and implementation can be done by
  different team members
- Documentation (079) can be written in parallel with final polish tasks

## Implementation Strategies

### Strategy 1: MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

Deliver P1 features first (Registration + Login), deploy to get user feedback,
then add P2/P3 features.

### Strategy 2: Incremental by Priority

Complete P1 stories → P2 stories → P3 stories in sequence. Deploy after each
priority level.

### Strategy 3: Parallel Development

Assign user stories to different developers, integrate at the end. Requires
strong coordination.

**Recommended**: Strategy 2 (Incremental by Priority) for this feature size.
