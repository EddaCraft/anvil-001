# Demo Development Workflow

Creates focused demos and prototypes with user experience design:

1. **Planning & Scope** - Define demo objectives and success criteria
2. **UX Design** - User flows, component inventory, and accessibility
   considerations
3. **Implementation** - Minimal viable demo focusing on key interactions
4. **Testing** - Validation of core user journeys and functionality

## Agent Sequence

- **planner**: Defines demo scope, key user journeys, and success criteria
- **ui-ux-designer**: Creates UI flows, component specifications, and acceptance
  criteria for front-end work
- **coder**: Implements the minimal demo with clean, maintainable code
- **tester**: Tests core user flows and validates demo functionality

## Usage

```
/demo "interactive data visualization dashboard"
```

Perfect for stakeholder presentations, user testing, or proof-of-concept
development.

## Output Artifacts

- User flow diagrams and wireframes
- Component specifications with props and accessibility notes
